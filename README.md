# AbstractParametric
A voro simulation to create and customize your own voronoicell

Done with OpenFrameworks and ofxVoro

I was looking at some very cool stuff done with voroni cells and decided to give them a try.
I wanted my object to be as closed to the user as possible, so i decided to allow the user to create 
it by drawing a shape with the mouse. After the shape was draws, a voroni cell pattern will simulate the shape the user did.

To be able to manipulate it, I added three main constraints: width, height and number of subdivisions. 
The interface has an UI that allows the user to easily change this parameters to construct their shape.
